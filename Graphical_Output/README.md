# Graphical Output

This folder contains **graphical outputs** generated during the Network Anomaly Detection project. These images help visualize the results of the different models and preprocessing steps.

## Contents

- **LSTM Autoencoder outputs**: Plots showing reconstruction error, loss curves, and detected anomalies.
- **OC-SVM outputs**: Graphs displaying decision boundaries and anomaly detection results.
- **LS-SVM outputs**: Visualizations of the classification results and evaluation metrics.
- **Other plots**: Any additional visualizations related to data preprocessing, feature distributions, or model comparisons.

## Usage

- Open the images to explore the visual results.
- These plots are referenced in the notebooks for easier understanding of model performance.
- When adding new visual outputs, include a descriptive filename for clarity, for example:
