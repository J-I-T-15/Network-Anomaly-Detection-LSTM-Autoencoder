# Network Anomaly Detection Using LSTM Autoencoder

## Overview
This project explores network anomaly detection using LSTM Autoencoder and compares its performance with OC-SVM and LS-SVM.

## Features
- LSTM Autoencoder for time-series anomaly detection
- Comparative analysis with OC-SVM and LS-SVM
- Fully implemented in Python (Google Colab)
